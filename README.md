# 5300-Giraffe
DB Relation Manager project for CPSC5300 at Seattle U, Winter 2023, Project Giraffe

The milestone 1 is composed of two seperate parts:
  1) Making DB_ENV
  2) Parsing the SQL command using SQL Parser.

 Each are seperated into two files. Labeled milestonesql.cpp and makingdbEnv.cpp,
 to make the files, each have a MakeFile. Each works perfectly. We wanted
 to seperate both parts in the milestone to get an understanding for
 both parts, along with each make files. Please ensure that the
 objects made by the make file targets the correct cpp files as the terminal files
 are different for each. 
 
 
 The milestone 2 is composed of one file all in three layers.
  1) The Slotted Page Class
  2) The Heapfile Class
  3) The Heaptable Class
  
  Each are class has it own method provide by Professor in the 
  heap_storage.h file. Both files are uploaded via git. Each
  purpose of the methods within each class are described 
  briefly in the Milestone 2 page in canvas.
