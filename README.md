# 5300-Giraffe
DB Relation Manager project for CPSC5300 at Seattle U, Winter 2023, Project Giraffe

The milestone 1 is composed of two seperate parts:
  1) Making DB_ENV
  2) Parsing the SQL command using SQL Parser.

 Each are seperated into two files. Labeled milestonesql.cpp and makingdbEnv.cpp,
 to make the files, each have a MakeFile. Each works perfectly.
